# Starter Template

Starter Template is a simple and cooked structure for start developing your projects with **HTM**L, **CSS**, **Sass**, and **Bootstrap5**.

  - Install dependecies
  - Watch your changes
  - Enjoy coding


### Tech

We used some tools to work properly and easily:

* [Bootstrap5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap for your styles
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS with superpowers!
* [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - Automate your workflow


### Installation

It requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
